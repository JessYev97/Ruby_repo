This repository holds my first projects in Ruby! 
Currently, I am working on:

"Project Mastermind" 

this is a game where the computer generates a code of four colors. 
The code is randomly generated from a set array of color options. 

The objective of the game is for the human player to correctly guess the code
based on feedback from the program each round.
